# Research Agent    
We will be creating a Research Agent that can perform research tasks across multiple phases. Each phase will have its own specific requirements, constraints, and success criteria.

- Defined by the prompt files in the `/workspaces/Agent-picks/Research-Agent/.github` directory, these phases will guide the agent's behavior and focus areas.

- The agent will utilize a custom chat mode defined in the `/workspaces/Agent-picks/Research-Agent/.github/chatmodes` directory, which specifies how the AI should behave, including response style and available tools.

- The agent will follow the instructions in the prompt files for each phase, ensuring that it adheres to the specific requirements and constraints outlined.

- The agent will be able to switch between different phases as needed, allowing for a flexible and adaptive research process.
