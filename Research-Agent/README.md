# Research Agent Framework Overview

The Research Agent framework is designed to facilitate efficient research tasks across multiple phases, providing a reusable structure that can be adapted for various projects. This framework includes specialized components such as chat modes, instructions, and prompts, which are essential for guiding the agent's behavior and ensuring context-aware responses. By defining clear phases with specific requirements and constraints, the framework aims to streamline the research process, allowing developers to quickly access relevant information and documentation without excessive token consumption.

Incorporating best practices for chat modes and instructions, the framework emphasizes modularity and reusability. Each component is crafted to support a wide range of research activities, from tool discovery to documentation generation. The goal is to create a versatile agent that can efficiently process and organize information, ultimately enhancing the research capabilities of developers across different projects. This approach not only improves productivity but also ensures that the agent remains adaptable to evolving project needs.
