# Agent Updates - Workspace Documentation & Orchestrator Refinement

## Changes Made

### 1. Research Agent - Workspace Documentation Added ✅

**File**: `.github/chatmodes/Research-Agent-code.chatmode.md`
- Added "Workspace Documentation (REQUIRED)" section
- Requires all outputs saved to `.agent-workspace/research/`
- Files: `findings.md`, `decision.md`

**File**: `.github/instructions/Research-Instructions.instructions.md`
- Added workspace documentation requirements
- Explains purpose: Orchestrator coordination and progress tracking

### 2. Coding Agent - Workspace Documentation Added ✅

**File**: `.github/chatmodes/Coding-Agent.chatmode.md`
- Added "Workspace Documentation (REQUIRED)" section
- Requires all outputs saved to `.agent-workspace/coding/`
- Files: `architecture.md`, `implementation.md`
- Must include: exact symbols, imports, hooks, functions, line numbers

**File**: `.github/instructions/Coding-Agent.instructions.md`
- Added workspace documentation requirements with format examples
- Shows exact reference format: `File: src/components/Button.tsx:45`
- Explains purpose: Orchestrator reads these for comparison and status explanation

### 3. Orchestrator Agent - Complete Refinement ✅

#### Chat Mode (Completely Rewritten)
**File**: `.github/chatmodes/Orchestrator.chatmode.md` (90 lines)

**Key Changes**:
- **Purpose**: "Brainstorming partner" who explains in simple English
- **Core Role**: Human communication, exact technical references, clarify ideas
- **Response Style**: 
  - Human & conversational (not robotic documentation)
  - Always include exact references (file:line, symbols, imports, hooks, workflows)
  - Ultra-concise (50-75 words max)
- **New Capabilities**:
  - Explain project status in plain language
  - Compare agent notes for conflicts
  - Route next agent with simple English explanation
  - Clarify user ideas and break down complexity
- **Core Principles**: Human first, exact references, stay concise, be decisive, simple English

#### Instructions (Completely Rewritten)
**File**: `.github/instructions/Orchestrator.instructions.md` (130 lines)

**Key Changes**:
- **5 Responsibilities** (expanded from 3):
  1. Explain Project Status (simple English + exact references)
  2. Compare Agent Notes (with exact file:line evidence)
  3. Route Next Agent (with plain English explanation)
  4. Clarify User Ideas (break down complexity, reference existing code)
  5. Track Progress (maintain project-state.md)
- **Response Formats**: 3 distinct formats for different use cases (status, routing, comparing)
- **Communication Style**: Clear DO/DON'T examples showing human vs robotic language
- **Memory Keys**: Added `orchestrator_project_summary` for current status

#### Prompts (All 3 Refined)

**1. Compare Notes** (65 lines - reduced from 76)
- Emphasizes exact file references in output
- Simple English conflict explanation
- Evidence-based correctness determination

**2. Track Progress** (58 lines - reduced from 70)
- Focus on simple English explanation
- Must include exact code references (file:line, symbols, workflow)
- Plain language status updates

**3. Pick Next Agent** (73 lines - reduced from 84)
- Explain routing in simple English
- Provide context from workspace
- Clear expected outputs

### 4. Workspace Structure Created ✅

**Directory**: `.agent-workspace/`
```
.agent-workspace/
  ├── research/
  │   ├── README.md       # Format guide for Research Agent
  │   ├── findings.md     # (created when Research runs)
  │   └── decision.md     # (created when Research runs)
  ├── coding/
  │   ├── README.md       # Format guide for Coding Agent
  │   ├── architecture.md # (created when Coding runs)
  │   └── implementation.md # (created when Coding runs)
  └── project-state.md     # Orchestrator maintains this
```

**Files Created**:
- `project-state.md`: Template for Completed/Current/Next tracking
- `research/README.md`: Format examples for Research outputs
- `coding/README.md`: Detailed format with exact reference examples

### 5. Documentation Added ✅

**File**: `Orchestrating-Agent/README.md` (240 lines)
- Complete user guide for Orchestrator Agent
- 4 usage examples (explain status, compare outputs, pick agent, clarify ideas)
- Workspace structure explanation
- Response style examples (DO vs DON'T)
- Integration with Research and Coding agents
- Example workflow showing full coordination
- Token efficiency metrics

**File**: `Orchestrating-Agent/USAGE.md` (20 lines) - Already existed
- Quick start guide maintained

## Key Improvements

### Human-First Communication
**Before**: "Analysis indicates state management library selection pending."
**After**: "You're at state management decision. Research found Zustand (12KB) vs Redux (45KB). Coding needs the decision to build the store."

### Exact Technical References
**Now includes**:
- File paths with line numbers: `src/auth/validator.ts:23`
- Exact symbols: `Function: validateToken`
- Imports: `import { jwt } from 'jsonwebtoken'`
- Hooks: `useEffect (line 28)`
- Workflows: `Login → validate → store token`

### Token Efficiency
**Orchestrator prompts**:
- Compare Notes: 65 lines (vs typical 100+)
- Track Progress: 58 lines (vs typical 90+)
- Pick Next Agent: 73 lines (vs typical 120+)

**Response limits**: 50-75 words maximum for fast iteration

### Coordination Requirements
**Research Agent**:
- MUST save to `.agent-workspace/research/`
- Updates after each phase

**Coding Agent**:
- MUST save to `.agent-workspace/coding/`
- Must include exact symbols, imports, line numbers
- Updates after each phase

**Orchestrator Agent**:
- Reads all workspace files
- Compares outputs for conflicts
- Explains in simple English with exact references
- Maintains `project-state.md`

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Research Agent saves outputs to `.agent-workspace/research/`
- [ ] Coding Agent saves outputs to `.agent-workspace/coding/`
- [ ] Coding outputs include exact file:line references
- [ ] Orchestrator reads workspace files correctly
- [ ] Orchestrator responses are 50-75 words
- [ ] Orchestrator uses simple English (not jargon)
- [ ] Orchestrator includes exact technical references
- [ ] Orchestrator can compare agent notes and find conflicts
- [ ] Orchestrator can explain project status plainly
- [ ] Orchestrator can route to next agent with clear reasoning

## Next Steps

1. Test Research Agent workflow → verify workspace documentation
2. Test Coding Agent workflow → verify exact references in output
3. Test Orchestrator comparison → verify conflict detection
4. Test full workflow: Research → Orchestrator compare → Coding → Orchestrator status
5. Validate response lengths stay under 75 words
6. Validate simple English (no jargon without explanation)

---

**Summary**: All three agents now coordinate through `.agent-workspace/`. Orchestrator acts as brainstorming partner explaining project in simple English while maintaining exact technical references. Research and Coding agents properly document their work for Orchestrator review.
